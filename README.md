## Rust Guessing game
Im currently learning rust in my free time. Im following allong with the rust book. The reason I'm learning rust is so I can build my own pentesing tools in rust, which I think would be really fun.
## No Ai
During my rust journey I wont be using any AI, while I do agree it helps alot when it comes to productivity, productivity is not my main focus when learning a skill. I have decided this because I want the deepest understanding when it comes to rust. I feel AI will simply lengthen the learning curve. In my opinion you dont have to think as deeply about what you want to acomplish or the problem your trying to solve when you use AI which can. So for these projects I refuse to use AI.
